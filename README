This is my Network Security course project at GSU.

It securely stores password(or any text) in server side. It uses Https and AES encryption. AES key exchange is done using SMS. 
For the SMS API, it uses textmagic.com as a service.

It is a web application developed in Scala on Play Framework, client side on Angular JS + Bootstrap.

It is useful if you like to see how to encypt a text with AES in server side using Scala/Java and decypt it on client side using Javascript.
